<p>This celebration is not a contest. We organise this so that  radio amateurs 
have a good time and promote Amateur Radio while helping to celebrate the unique
position railways hold in our national heritage.</p>

<p>If you would like to take part by running a station, approach your nearest 
preserved railway, ask if they are celebrating the birth of passenger railways 
in this country and would they like to have an Amateur Radio Station as part of 
their event to promote awareness of their railway.</p>

<p>Tell them about the QSL card and how it could be of benefit to them, they may
even provide a picture and help with the cost of printing.</p>

<p>Once you have their agreement, apply for a special license in the usual way 
with OFCOM. Please leave plenty of time for this application to be published.
</p>

<p><span class="red label">IMPORTANT</span> Please note, all clubs/groups or 
individuals MUST have their own INSURANCE for the event. Neither B.A.R.A.C. or 
the preserver railway will take any responsibility for the running of your 
station.</p>


<h2>Registering your station</h2>

<p>Once you have the details of your station, simply register the details on 
this website to keep everyone up-to-date with the latest news. We will liaise 
with the RSGB to publicise the event and list your station.</p>

<p>The latest version of this website allows you to fully manage your callsigns 
and operator details for all events, save your details for future registrations,
and contribute information about the railways you celebrate.</p>


<h2>After the event</h2>

<p>Once the event is over and you have made more than 10 contacts, please submit
your QSO log via the website. We will then produce a special certificate for 
you to present to your host railway and for your shack, which you can download 
from this site.</p>
